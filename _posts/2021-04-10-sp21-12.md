title:  "Week 11: Sample Means"
category: d8sp21
---

There are some interesting properties to collecting the means of bootstrapped samples. CLT states that the distribution of sample means is normal. This is a big win, since we know a lot about the normal distribution. Furthermore, the standard deviation of this bell curve generated from sample means depends on the SD of the Sample Means and your sample size. Lastly, this week we will also look more into handling and standardizing data. This will be the first step up to the Machine Learning portion of the class.
