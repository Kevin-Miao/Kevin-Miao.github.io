This week's quiz covered a little bit more general Java questions to wrap up getting used to programming in Java.
As we slowly move closer into the summer, we will be transitioning to **Data Structures**. This week, you learned about the different implementations of LinkedList, something which will come in handy for project 1: Deques. Below you can find resources that are related to this week's material. This week's worksheet will be more comprehensive and it is certain the we won't be able to cover it in section completely. Therefore, I will start posting worksheet walkthrough videos after the last tutoring section has ended. If you have any questions, please email me: [kjhmiao@berkeley.edu](mailto:kjhmiao@berkeley.edu).
