title:  "Week 3 Discussion: Data Types & Table Manipulations"
category: d8sp21
---

This week we will be diving a little deeper into **python** and using **tables** with the **datascience** library. As we know, a lot of data lives in **tables**. In this discussion, we will be going over how to extract and change values in this table as well as how to deal with errors that might come up while programming. This requires some knowledge of data types too, which we will quickly cover in the beginning of discussion.
