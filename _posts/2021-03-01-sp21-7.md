We will slowly be transitioning into the statistical inference part of the class. How do we make decision based on data and uncertainty? We will start formalizing these processes with **hypothesis testing**. It is essential that you understand the underlying fundamentals of probability (i.e. bayes rule, sampling and the law of averages).

### Corresponding Readings/Resources

Last year as a tutor, I created a slidedeck summarizing the use of the random functions. Feel free to refer to those.

Those readings are not required or necessary. However, if you feel that you want to brush up before coming to section or feel iffy about certain topics after discussion, you are encouraged to go through the readings.
