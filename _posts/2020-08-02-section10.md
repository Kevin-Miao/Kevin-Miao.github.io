## Graphs and Algorithms

Graphs are extremely powerful abstraction tools for reality.
Think about weather forecasting, Google Maps or even language.
Many problems in real life depend on a graph representation.
This week we will be talking about the representation of graphs, how to traverse through graphs and how to solve the **shortest path** problem, something that you will need in BearMaps when implementing route navigation.
