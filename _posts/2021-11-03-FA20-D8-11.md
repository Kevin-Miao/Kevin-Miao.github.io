Don't forget to vote ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ everyone! This week we will have a lot of topics to cover ranging from mean/median, variability, SDs & curves, the Central Limit Theorem and Sample Means. All these topics are closely related, but together form a very fundamental basis for statistical inference which we will find out and discover in this week's worksheet.

**Video will be posted on Thursday. Thank you for your patience.**
