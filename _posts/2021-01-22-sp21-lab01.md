First of all, welcome to Data 8!

This week will be all about getting you all set-up for the upcoming semester where you will learn all the fundamentals of Data Science! For this week, there are no corresponding readings. Please make sure that you have access to all the online integrations that we are using in the class, i.e. Piazza, Gradescope, OkPy and DataHub (Jupyter). The course policy has been outlined in our syllabus on [the website](http://data8.org/sp21/policies.html). Everything has been summarized in the slides below.

For more questions about **this lab** specifically, please email [Ryan](mailto:ryanchien04@berkeley.edu) or [Kevin](mailto:kevinmiao@cs.berkeley.edu)

Please note that your assigned labs and discussions, which you will start attending next week, might not be the same as this week.
