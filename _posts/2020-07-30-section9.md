## Heaps, Priority Queues and Hashing

Congratz! You completed Midterm 2! We are almost there. This week we will be going over heaps, priority queues and hashing. Hashing is an extremely powerful tools that allows for constant time lookup and addition of items through combining arrays, LinkedList and some math tricks that allow for spreading out the load. Priority Queues and Heaps are other data structures that allow us to efficiently process items from a list of items that need to be processed in order of priority. Both the Heap and PriorityQueue have a max or min version in which we either process the item with the max/min priority accordingly
