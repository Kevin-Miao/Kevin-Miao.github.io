Last week, we quickly covered basic Python Syntax. Now we are getting more into the weeds of programming, we are slowly getting more and more equipped with the tools to do some real data analysis. This worksheet will be covering **tabular methods** and **histograms**. This corresponds to the following parts of the textbook:

- [Chapter 6 - Tables](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/06/Tables.html)
- [Chapter 7.2 - Numerical Distributions](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/07/2/Visualizing_Numerical_Distributions.html)
