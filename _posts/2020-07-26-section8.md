## k-D Trees and Tries

Sometimes we are dealing with grids with multiple dimensions. For example, in your new BearMaps implementation, you will be working with (x,y)-coordinates.
A very efficient data structure to traverse and navigate through sets of these values is the k-D tree.
Tries, similarly, are efficient data structures to hold lexicographic sets (words).
