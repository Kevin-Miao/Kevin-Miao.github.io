## Midterm Review: Deques and LinkedLists

Sorry that the promised video for worksheet 3 never came. Starting from this week, all tutors will be posting one video pertaining to the worksheets so to ease up the workload. This week, we will be going over Midterm Preparation Questions and I will be offering one Conceptual Section as well (Where you can drop in and ask me anything about any topic in scope of the midterm).

**Resources**
- [Practice Midterm](/assets/docs/WorksheetMT1.pdf)
- [Notes and Solutions (4-6)](/)

**Walkthrough videos**
- To be announced by all the tutors collectively.

### Note: The tutoring worksheets are property of CS61B(L) and are solely intended for the purpose of personal use.
