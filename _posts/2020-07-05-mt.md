## Midterm Review: Deques and LinkedLists

Sorry that the promised video for worksheet 3 never came. Starting from this week, all tutors will be posting one video pertaining to the worksheets so to ease up the workload. This week, we will be going over Midterm Preparation Questions and I will be offering one Conceptual Section as well (Where you can drop in and ask me anything about any topic in scope of the midterm).
