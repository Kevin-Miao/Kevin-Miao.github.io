title:  "Week 14: Classification and Conditional Probability"
category: d8sp21
---

This week we will be going over how to work with categorical data. How do we create a model if we want to output labels instead? We will be going over an intuitive algorithm, k-Nearest Neighbors. Additionally, we will dive a little deeper into Conditional Probability. Conditional Probability is the core of Data Science, Machine Learning and Statistics. 

Thank you for attending discussion and labs. It was an honor to have you all as students. :)
