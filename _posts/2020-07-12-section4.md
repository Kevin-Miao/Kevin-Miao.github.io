## Dynamic Method Selection and Inheritance

You are done with midterm 1! ðŸŽ‰ Take some time to relax, but also be aware that the next project is coming up soon. Get started on Gitlet as early as possible, so you don't have to stress out as much. Today we will be discussing Dynamic Method Selection and Inheritance.
We will go over the following topics:
- The difference between classes and interfaces
- Overriding and Overloading
- Dynamic and Static Types
Videos will be posted soon!

**Resources**
- [Worksheet Week 4](/assets/docs/Worksheet4.pdf)

**Walkthrough videos**

**Static/Dynamic Type**
- My fellow tutor [Scott Durand]() made an amazing video on Static/Dynamic Types. If you are confused, I definitely recommend you checking out his videos. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FML84mwrcSE&list=PLDMWsWbBOBRKf_Ze-TRX_uvEVuvOI0mbK&index=6&t=0s)
