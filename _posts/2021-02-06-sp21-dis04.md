Understanding your dataset is extremely important if you want to move to numerical inference or to prediction. We have to look for patterns that make sense and are tangible to us. Visualizations and histograms are precisely able to convey these messages to us in an extremely effective manner.

### Corresponding Readings

Those readings are not required or necessary. However, if you feel that you want to brush up before coming to section or feel iffy about certain topics after discussion, you are encouraged to go through the readings.
