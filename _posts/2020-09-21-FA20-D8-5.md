This week, we will be covering **histograms** again and try to get a little bit more practice with respect to that. We will also be covering **functions**. Specifically, we will look at the design of functions and how to work with them. Corresponding sections in the textbook that are useful for this week's topics:

- [Chapter 7.2 - Numerical Distributions](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/07/2/Visualizing_Numerical_Distributions.html)
- [Chapter 8 - Functions](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/Functions_and_Tables.html)
