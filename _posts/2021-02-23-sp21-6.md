title:  "Week 6: Control Flow and Iteration"
category: d8sp21
---

In lecture, professor Ayazifar taught you about **control flow** and **iteration**, well known as **conditionals**/**if-statements** and **for loops**. **Conditionals** allow us to make our programming more generalizable. Based on a certain value, we can output a different value or perform different operations. **For loops** are to allow us to do the same thing, but then for multiple things. It creats the infrastructure for us to iterate over each item in an iterable (in Data 8, you can just think of this as a list.) in as few as 2 lines.
