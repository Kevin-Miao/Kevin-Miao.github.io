## Stacks and Queues

**Stacks** and **Queues** are data structures in which for the obtainment of a specific item it matters when you added it to the specific fringe. A stack works according to a Last in First out method where newer items will be popped off before the items that were pushed on the stack earlier. A queue, on the other side, is a data structures where the first item that came in will be the first one to be dequeued, literally like a queue. These data structures despite its simplicity play a fundamental role in tree traversals as the respectively are used as a fringe for DFS and BFS.
