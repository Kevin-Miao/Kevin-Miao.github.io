Welcome to my portfolio website! The website is currently under construction. However, feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:kevinmiao@berkeley.edu) (kevinmiao@berkeley.edu) or any other platform, such as [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/MiaoK). My resume and other information can be accessed through there as well. I would be more than happy to meet you.

At this moment, I am still pursuing a Data Science/Software Engineer/Machine Learning internship for the upcoming summer, my last summer before graduating from UC Berkeley.
