## Academics

> "Computer Science Classes and Students straight up intimidated me."

<span style="font-size:18px;">My time at **UC Berkeley** has been quite an adventure so far. Currently, I am set on graduating in the **spring of 2021** majoring in <b>Computer Science</b>. My GPA is <b>3.838</b> as of now. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I had gotten into *University of Leiden*'s medical program. Instead I chose Berkeley, I was set on majoring in Biology and Latin. After my first DS class, it was astonishing to me how Data Inference and Machine Learning worked and declared Data Science as major. During senior year, I realized that it was not Data Science but Computer Science that I fell in love with. It straight up intimidated me my first years and that is why I had avoided it. But, recently I took the switch and declared CS officially, a decision that I do not regret. *My current goal is to go to graduate school and then eventually end up in the industry as a Machine Learning/Software Engineer.*</span>

<!-- Sequence   | Result                                                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a?c`       | Matches `abc`, `axc`, and `aac`. Does not match `ac`, `abbc`, |
|             | or `a/c`.                                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a*c`       | Matches "ac", "abc" and "azzzzzzzc". Does not match "a/c".    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `foo...bar` | Matches "foobar", "fooxbar", and "fooz/blaz/rebar". Does not  |
|             | match "fo/obar", "fobar" or "food/bark".                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `....obj`   | Matches all files anywhere in the current hierarchy that end  |
|             | in ".obj". Note that the first three periods are interpreted  |
|             | as "...", and the fourth one is interpreted as a literal "."  |
|             | character.                                                    |

### Teaching

For me, teaching has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have had at Berkeley. I have been lucky enough to be part of the course staff of the following two classes.

- **Data 8**
  - *8 hour uGSI* This is my 6th semester being part of the course staff for Data 8 and the 3rd time teaching for it. Irrespective of my long involvement, I feel like that I keep learning new things every rotation of the class.
- **CS61BL: Data Structures**
  - *15 hour group tutor and reader* During the summer of 2020, I have had the opportunity to be teach for Data Structures. I recall it was one class that I was not looking forward to, but this scary expectation was overblown. CS61B was my favorite class and made me think about majoring in Computer Science. It was a good experience and managed to do away with those overblown rumors about Data Structures it being scary.
