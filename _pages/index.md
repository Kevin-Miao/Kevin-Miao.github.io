My name is Kevin Miao, a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in **Data Science** with an emphasis in Biology and minoring in **Computer Science**. My interests lay in the intersection of Medicine/Biology and Machine Learning/Computer Vision. Currently, I am involved at the [Hong Lab](https://honglab.ucsf.edu/#team) at UCSF. More specifically, I am working on creating a Machine Learning algorithm that predicts whether certain cancer patients are at higher risk of being hospitalized or admitted to the E.R. after receiving outpatient chemotherapy. After this project, I hope to start a project that combines this predictive component with a computer vision component.

Additionally, I truly love teaching my favorite two classes at UC Berkeley: `Data Structures` (CS61BL) as well as `Intro into Data Science` (Data 8). The resources for these classes have been linked under the [Teaching](/teach) tab.

**This website is currently under construction.** Feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:kevinmiao@berkeley.edu) (kevinmiao@berkeley.edu). My resume is available upon request! My apologies for the inconvenience.
