My name is Kevin Miao, a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in **Computer Science** with an extensive background in Machine Learning and Bioinformatics. My interests lay in the intersection of Medicine/Biology and Machine Learning/Computer Vision. Currently, I am working at the [Hong Lab](https://honglab.ucsf.edu/#team) at UCSF as well as the [Berkeley RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/).

At the **Hong Lab**, I am creating Machine Learning algorithms that predict whether high risk patients will end up in the hospital after receiving outpatient chemotherapy. At the **Rise Lab**, I am constructing new explainable Deep Learning frameworks for lung disease diagnoses together with Suzie Petryk (PhD student under Joseph Gonzalez).

I also truly love giving back to the community through teaching at UC Berkeley as a TA for Data 8 as well as mentoring students at the Data Science Society. Besides teaching, I like to give back to the community through working with Dutch/EU political parties to brainstorm about solutions to ensure a responsible, safe yet innovative future for technological advancements.
