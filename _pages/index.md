My name is Kevin Miao, a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in **Computer Science Science** with an extensive background in Data Science and Bioinformatics. My interests lay in the intersection of Medicine/Biology and Machine Learning/Computer Vision. Currently, I am involved at the [Hong Lab](https://honglab.ucsf.edu/#team) at UCSF as well as the [Berkeley RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/).

At the **Hong Lab**, I am working on creating Machine Learning algorithms that predicts whether high risk patients will end up in the hospital after receiving outpatient chemotherapy. Currently, we are wrapping up the paper and are expected to test this out in the clinic. Under the **Rise Lab**, I am working with Suzie Petryk (PhD student under Joseph Gonzalez) with working on constructing new Deep Learning frameworks useful in  the Medical Imaging field.

Besides actively engaging with Machine Learning, I truly love teaching it too. I have been engaged on the course staff at UC Berkeley for the following two courses: `Data Structures` (CS61BL) as well as `Intro into Data Science` (Data 8). The resources for these classes have been linked under the [Teaching](/teach) tab.

Lastly, I like being active within the UC Berkeley Data Science Community too. As of now, I have been a **project manager** for two semesters now. A project manager oversees and manages a group of approximately 6 consultants for **machine learning** projects with different companies. Currently, I am working with series-D funded startup **Monday.com**.

**This website is currently under construction.** Feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:kevinmiao@berkeley.edu) (kevinmiao@berkeley.edu). My resume is available upon request! My apologies for the inconvenience.
