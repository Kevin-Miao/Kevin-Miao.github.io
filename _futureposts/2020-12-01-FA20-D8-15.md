Last section of the year! :( Today we will be going over **Nearest Neighbor** classification, one of the most intuitive Machine Learning Topics.

It was a pleasure working with you all. I'd be more than happy to chat with you all about classes, school or anything else. Feel free to email me: kevinmiao@cs.berkeley.edu

Also, one more thing! Good luck with finals. You got it!
